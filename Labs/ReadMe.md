## Introduction
Our labs project help you get ramped up with Azure Security Center and provide hands-on practical experience for product features, capabilities, and scenarios. The labs are divided into 3 main tracks, a beginner (level 100/200) and an advanced (level 300+) track. The labs contain several modules cover different pillars such as Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) to Cloud Workload Protection  (CWP). To start using our labs, you will need to create Azure Trial Subscription which provides you all capabilities for 30 days – so you have to finish this lab at this point to take advantage of the free trial. We continually update the content to include the latest capabilities – please feel free to [submit issue](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center/issues/new/choose) for any changes and suggestions.
