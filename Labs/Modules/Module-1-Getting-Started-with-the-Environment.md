# Module 1 â€“ Getting Started with the Environment

## Overview

In this module, you will learn how to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud in your subscription

## Objectives

You will be performing the following activities to achieve the goal:

  - Exercise 1: Log in to Azure Portal
  - Exercise 2: Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud
  - Exercise 3: Creating Microsoft Defender for Cloud Default Policy

## Exercise 1: Log in to Azure Portal

In this exercise, you will learn how to login to the Azure Portal in the labvm-xxxxxx using user credentials provided under the Environment Details to access the Azure Portal

### Instructions 

1. After the environment is provisioned successfully, your browser will load up the **Lab Guide** along with a virtual machine called **labvm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**. This virtual machine will be your platform throughout the course of the workshop. In case you do not see the **labvm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** load up on the left side of the screen, navigate to the **Virtual Machines** tab on the top right of the **Lab Guide** and check the status of the virtual machine. Alternatively, you can directly RDP into LabVM using the credentials provided in the **Environment Details** tab.
