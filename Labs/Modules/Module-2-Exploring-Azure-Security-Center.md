# Module 2 - Exploring Microsoft Defender for Cloud

### Overview

In this module, you will explore the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Dashboard feature overview.

## Objectives

You will be performing the following activities to achieve the goal:

* Exercise 1: Understanding Microsoft Defender for Cloud Dashboard
* Exercise 2: Exploring Secure Score and Recommendations
* Exercise 3: Exploring the Inventory Capability

### Exercise 1: Understanding Microsoft Defender for Cloud Dashboard

In this exercise, you will be interacting with the Microsoft Defender for Cloud dashboard, which provides a unified view of the security posture of your hybrid cloud workloads. Additionally, it shows security alerts, coverage information, and more.

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the Azure portal (perform if not already on the Microsoft Defender for Cloud page).

2. The Microsoft Defender for Cloud Overview page provides a unified view for security professionals. This page contains detailed insights on the security posture on its dedicated dashboard and includes multiple independent cloud security pillars such as **Secure Score, Regulatory Compliance, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

   > ❗ Important: <br>
   > Microsoft Defender for Cloud takes time to populate information such as secure scores, compliance, recommendations, etc. after enabling the services and enrolling the servers to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. It could require up to 24 hours for all the information to appear. If you don't see it, please return later to check again.

3. Note that the **Subscriptions** icon on the **top menu bar** allows you to view and filter subscriptions. In this lab, we will use only one subscription, but for your reference, selecting different/additional subscriptions will adjust the interface to reflect the security posture for the specified subscription.

    ![Microsoft Defender for Cloud: subscriptions](../Images/msdefender1.png)

4. Click on the **What’s new** button; a new tab will open with the latest release notes, where you can stay updated on the new features, bug fixes, and more.

    ![Microsoft Defender for Cloud: what's new](../Images/msdefender2.png)

5. Note the **high-level numbers** at the top menu. This view allows you to see a summary of your **Azure subscriptions, Assessed resources, Active secure score recommendations and Security alerts.**

    ![Microsoft Defender for Cloud: Dashboard](../Images/mod1-ex3-1.png)

6. On the **Overview** page, look at the **Security posture** tile. You can see your current score along with the number of **Completed controls and Completed recommendations**. Clicking on this tile will redirect you to a drill-down view across subscriptions.

    ![Overview: Secure Score tile](../Images/asc-overview-secure-score-tile2.png)

    > ⭐ Good to know: <br>
    > The higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.

7. From the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** page Select the **Workload Protections** from the **Cloud Security** section.

    ![](../Images/workload1.png)

8. On the **Workload Protections (1)**, under Cloud Security, you can see the coverage of your **connected resources (2)** for the currently selected subscription. Your current resource coverage should be **fully covered 100% (3)**, which means **full protection**. Additionally, you can also view the recent **security alerts (4)** color-coded by severity.

     ![Overview: Microsoft Defender  for Cloud tile](../Images/workload%20protection1.png)

   >**Note**: Resource coverage will take about 5-6 hrs to change the status to **fully covered 100%**.

9. Next, select **Regulatory Compliance** from the **Cloud Security** section of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud page.

     ![](../Images/regulatory1.png)

10. On the **Regulatory Compliance (1)** tile, you can get insights into your compliance posture based on a continuous assessment of both Azure and hybrid cloud environments. This tile shows the following standards, which are **Microsoft cloud security benchmark (2)**.
 
     ![Overview: Regulatory Compliance tile](../Images/c4.png)
     
11. Next Click on **Inventory** from the **General** section of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud. It shows the number of unmonitored VMs alongside the total covered resources; **you should expect to have zero unmonitored VMs**. Resources are classified according to their health status.

     > ❗ Important: <br>
     > Unmonitored VMs are considered virtual machines that have a Log Analytics agent deployed, but the agent isn't sending data or has other health issues.
     > 
     > **Note:** If in case there are any resources under Unmonitored resources, then please proceed further with Exercise 2 and come back later to check on the same.

### Exercise 2: Exploring Secure Score and Recommendations

**Exploring Secure Score**

Previously, we explored the Secure Score tile on the overview page. 

In this exercise you will dive into this capability and the associated recommendations. Microsoft Defender for Cloud mimics the work of a security analyst, reviewing the security recommendations and applying advanced algorithms to determine how crucial each recommendation is. Microsoft Defender for Cloud constantly reviews the active recommendations and calculates the score based on them. All findings are aggregated into a single score (Secure Score), which measures the current security posture of your subscription(s); the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.
Exploring secure score

1. Type **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the search box located on the top of the **Azure Portal** page and click to open it.

    ![](../Images/lab-all.png)

2. From the left navigation pane, under the **Cloud Security** section, select **Security posture**.

    ![](../Images/securescor1.png)

3. On the Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Secure Score page, review your current **Overall Secure Score**.

     > **Note:** It could require up to 24 hours for secure score to appear. If you don't see it, please return later to check again.
   > ⭐ Notice: <br>
   > The score is shown as a percentage value; you can also see the points based on which the score is calculated next to the percentage. See the following example:
   > 
   > ![Overall Secure Score](../Images/md2ex2stp3.png)
   > 
   > For more information on how the score is calculated, [refer to the secure score documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/secure-score-security-controls#how-your-secure-score-is-calculated).

    **Exploring Security Controls and Recommendations**


6. On the **Recommendations (1)** page, use the **Switch to classic view** button at the top menu and pay attention to the first part of the page, the **summary view (2)**. It includes the progress on the **Recommendations status** (both completed security controls and recommendations), and **Resource health** (by severity).

    ![Recommendations view](../Images/mod2-ex2-1.png)

2. From the top menu, click on the **Download CSV report** button; this allows you to get a snapshot of your resources, their health status, and the associated recommendations. You can use this file for pivoting and reporting.

    ![](../Images/csv%20report1.png)
   
7. Under **Recommendation**, search and select **Storage account public access should be disallowed** recommendation from the **All recommendations** list.

    ![](../Images/mod2-ex2-3.png)

8. On the top section, notice the following:

   - Title of the recommendation: **Storage account public access should be disallowed**
   - Top menu controls: **Exempt**, **Deny**, **View policy definition** and **Open query**
   - Severity indicator: **Medium**
   - Freshness interval: **30 Min** 
   - Tactics and techniques: **Initial Access**

        ![Recommendation top menu](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Security-Immersion/blob/main/Labs/Images/stacc%20public%20access.png?raw=true)

9. The next important part is the **Remediation Steps** which contains the remediation logic where you can remediate the selected resources.

10. Under **Affected resources**, **select a resource** (the single **storage account** on the Unhealthy resources) and click on **Fix**. This will automatically apply the remediation to the selected resource.

     ![](../Images/c2.png)

       > **Note:** If storage account has already been moved to the **Healthy resources** tab, then move on to the next exercise.

11. This will open a new window - **Fixing resources**, review the implications for this remediation and click on **Fix 1 resource**.

     ![](../Images/c3.png)
  
12. Wait for a notification: ✅ **Remediation successful** - Successfully remediated the issues on the selected resources.
    
    > **Note**: It can take several minutes after remediation is completed to see the resources in the 'healthy resources' tab. You can move on to the next task and come back later to check on this.

    > **Info**: In the recommendation list, you can now see some recommendations flagged as in the preview. They aren’t included in the calculation of your score. They should still be remediated so that when the preview period ends, they will contribute towards your final score.

### Exercise 3: Exploring the Inventory Capability

Asset inventory dashboard allows you to get a single pane of glass view of all your resources covered by Microsoft Defender for Cloud. It also provides per-resource visibility to all Microsoft Defender for Cloud’s information and additional resource details, including security posture and protection status. Since this dashboard is based on the Azure Resource Graph (ARG), you can run queries across subscriptions at a large scale quickly and easily.

In this exercise, you will be exploring the Inventory capabality in the Microsoft defender for cloud.

1. Type **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the search box located on the top of the **Azure Portal** page and click to open it. From the left navigation pane, under the **General** section, select the **Inventory** button.

     ![](../Images/lab2-2.png)
    
2. Hover to the **Summaries strip** at the top of the page.

    ![Remediate a resource](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Security-Immersion/blob/main/Labs/Images/inventory1.1.png?raw=true)

    > **Note**: In your environment, these numbers may not be the same since they vary in time

3. Notice the total number of resources. The total number of resources are the ones that are connected to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud, not the total number of resources that you have in your subscriptions.

4. Notice the number of **unhealthy resources**, The unhealthy resources are the resources with actionable recommendations based on the selected filter.

5. Notice the **unmonitored resources**, The unmonitored resources indicate if there are resources with a Log Analytics agent deployed but with health issues. Since we enabled the auto-provisioning in the previous module, all existing VMs are covered and connected, which means they are monitored.

6. Use the **Filter by name** box to search for **linux** **(1)**. You should now see a filtered view containing your desired resource: **asclab-linux**. Hover on the red bar in the **recommendations** column to see a tooltip with the **active recommendations (2)**. You should expect to see **Active-xx of xx Recommendations** – these are the active recommendations you must attend.

    ![linux-recommendations](../Images/ex3.step7.png)

7. Open the resource health pane by selecting the resource. Click on **asclab-linux**. Alternately. You can also right-click on any resource and select **View resource**. You may not see **View resource** directly due to different screen resolutions, then you have to click on ellipse(...) and then select **View resource**.

    ![Remediate a resource](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Security-Immersion/blob/main/Labs/Images/viewres.png?raw=true)

8. On the resource health pane for **asclab-linux**, review the virtual machine information alongside the recommendation list.

    ![Remediate a resource](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Security-Immersion/blob/main/Labs/Images/healthpreview.png?raw=true)

    > **Note**: It could take up to 24 hours for all the recommendations to show up. And it is possible that during lab time, this may not show up – which is the case sometimes. If you don't see the data in **recommendations**. You can continue to the next exercise and verify this later.

9. Navigate back to the Inventory page and clear the search keyword **Linux**. Then from the filter menu, select the **Resource Groups (1)** filter and then provide the **value (2)** **asclab-aks** (unselect remaining), and click on **Ok (3)**. Using this filter, you can see all resources related to the predefined Kubernetes resources that are monitored with active recommendations.

     ![Remediate a resource](../Images/filter-rg.png)

    > **Note:** The list can be filtered and sorted.

10. From the filter menu, select the **Resource Group** filter and **select all** under the Value and click on **Ok**. Again, from the filter menu, select **Recommendations**, uncheck the **Select all** option under the Value, and then select **Auditing on SQL Server should be enabled** and click on **Ok**. You can also use the search area within the filter to better find items across the list. When you are done exploring, remember to clear your filter.

    > **Note**: If you don't see **Auditing on SQL Server should be enabled** in search results, that means it is not loaded yet for recommendations, and it could take up to 24 hours for all the recommendations to show up. It is possible that during lab time, this may not show up – which is the case sometimes. If you don't see the data in **Recommendations**, you can note down this step number, then continue to the next exercise and verify this later.

11. Tags are a very common asset management feature within Azure. With the help of this feature, resources can be tagged using a Tag name and value. These assigned tags can organize your assets and categorize them with the help of filters. Let us now assign the following Tags:

  * Filter the **Resource types** column to include only **App Services or web services**: Select the **Resource type** filter and select **function apps and web apps** under the Value and Click on **OK**
  * **Select** the checkboxes of the two app services named *asclab-fa-xx* and *asclab-app-xx*. (Here **xx** is the unique ID of resource).
  * From the top menu, click **Assign tags**
  * Assign `Environment` as the name and  `Production` as the value.
  * Click **Save**.

   > **Note**: If you don't see App Services in the Resource type filter, that means it is not loaded yet to recommendations. Note down this step number and verify this later.

   ![Inventory: Assign tags](../Images/c6.gif?raw=true)
   
12. From the filter pane, remove the **Resource type** filter then go to **Add filter** and notice the **Security findings** filter – it allows you to find all resources that are prone to a specific vulnerability. You can also search for CVE, KB ID, name and missing update.

13. From the filter pane, remove the **Security findings** filter you added in the previous step, and then from the top menu, click on **Open query**.

    ![Inventory: Assign tags](../Images/inventory-open-query-new.1.png)

16. On the **Azure Resource Graph Explorer** blade, click on **Run query**. You should now have the same list of resources and columns as in the previous step. This query is editable for your needs, and here it gets very powerful.
 
    ![Inventory: Assign tags](../Images/run-query.1.png)

17. Save the query for later use by clicking on **Save as** from the top menu. You can use it to create periodic reports. Name the report as **asc-filtered-query** and select **Save**.

    ![Inventory: Assign tags](../Images/M2-EX3-17.png)

> ⭐ Good to know: <br>
> The Inventory dashboard is fully built on top of the Azure Resource Graph (ARG) which stores all of Microsoft Defender's cloud security posture data and leverages its powerful KQL engine.
> It enables you to reach deep insights quickly and easily on top of Microsoft Defender for cloud data and cross-reference with any other resource properties.
