### Exercise 2: Explore Azure Policy

Azure Policy keeps track of compliance for your Azure resources based on policy definitions you assign, these are called policy assignments. By default, Microsoft provides many built-in definitions that you can leverage as you see fit.

In this exercise, you will be exploring azure policy and verify the built-in initiatives by microsoft defender for cloud.

1. Type **Policy** in the search box located at the top of the **Azure Portal** page and click on it. Alternately, open a new browser tab in the **labvm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and navigate to this link ```https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade```.

    ![](../Images/m3ex2.step1.png)

2. From the left navigation pane, under the **Authoring** section, click on **Definitions (1)**. From the top menu, use the filter ribbon, set the _Definition Type_ as **Initiative (2)**, select **Security Center (3)** from the _Category_ filter, and click on **Apply (5)**.

    ![policy assignment](../Images/Sh29.png)	

4. You can now see built-in initiatives used by Microsoft Defender for Cloud which includes :
    -	*Azure Security Benchmark*
    -	*Configure Azure Defender to be enabled on SQL Servers and SQL Managed Instance*
    -	*Configure Advanced Threat Protection to be enabled on open-source relational databases*

   ![policy assignment](../Images/Sh30.png)

5. Notice the number of policies included in each initiative (policies column).

6. To see current assignments, click on **Assignments** from the left navigation pane under **Authoring**. Policy initiatives have a different name for the assignments, for example:

    - *ASC Default*

7. Click on **ASC Default** to see the assignment details.

   ![policy assignment](../Images/Sh31.png) 

### Exercise 3: Create resource exemption for a recommendation

Resource exemption will allow increased granularity for you to fine-tune recommendations by providing the ability to exempt certain resources from evaluation.

In this exercise, you will create an exemption by clicking the ellipsis menu on the right side and then selecting Create an exemption.

   > **Note:** Exemptions is a premium Azure policy capability that's offered for Azure Defender customers with no additional cost. For other users, charges may apply in the future.

1. Type **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the search box located at the top of the **Azure Portal** page and click on it.

2. Select **Recommendations (1)** from the left navigation pane. Search and select the **Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines (2)** recommendation from the **All recommendations** tab, select the **asclab-win** resource. You can search it using the search box.

    > **Note**: If you don't see the above recommendation that means it is not loaded yet to the control list and it could take up to 24 hours for all the recommendations to show up. It is possible that during lab time, this may not show up – which is the case sometimes. You can note down this step number then continue to the next exercise and verify this later.

    ![policy assignment](../Images/asc-win.png)

4. From the right-navigation pane click on **Exempt**.

    ![](../Images/exempt.png)

5. The **Exempt pane** opens:
    - Name: **ASC-Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines**.
    - Check the **Set an expiration date** option and set the datetime for two days ahead at 12:00 AM.
    - Select **Waiver (risk accepted)** as exemption category.
    - Enter **ASC-Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines** for the Exemption description and click on **Create**.

        ![](../Images/exempt-01.png)

        > ⭐ Good to know: <br>
        > **Mitigated** - This issue isn't relevant to the resource because it's been handled by a different tool or process than the one being suggested
        > **Waiver** - Accepting the risk for this resource

6. It might take up to **30 min for the exemption to take effect**. Once this happens:
    - The resource doesn't impact your secure score.
    - The resource is listed in the Not applicable tab of the recommendation details page
    - The information strip at the top of the recommendation details page lists the number of exempted resources: **1**
    
    <br>

7. Refresh the tab and open the **Not applicable resources** tab to review your exempted resource – you can see our resource along with the reason/description value.

    ![Exempttion tab](../Images/m3fs4.png)

8.	Exemption rules are based on Azure Policy capability. Therefore, you can track all your exemptions from Azure Policy Blade as well.

9. In the search box located at the top of the Azure Portal page, search for **Policy** and click on it. 

    ![](../Images/m3ex2.step1.png)

10. Next, select Exemptions from the left navigation pane. Notice your newly created exemption listed there.

    ![Exempttion tab](../Images/m3-Ex3-10.png)

### Exercise 4: Create policy enforcement and deny

In this exercise, you will learn how to use Azure Policy to do some of the more common tasks related to assigning, denying, and managing policies across your organization.

1. In the search box located at the top of the Azure Portal page, search for **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and click on it.

2. From the left side pane of **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, select **Recommendations** under **General**.

3. Search and select the **Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled**. You can search it using the search box.

   > **Note**: If you don't see the above recommendation that means it is not loaded yet and it could take up to 24 hours for all the recommendations to show up. It is possible that during lab time, this may not show up – which is the case sometimes. You can note down this step number then continue to the next exercise and verify this later.

4. From the right-navigation pane, scroll down and click on **Deny** button. 

   > ❗ Important: <br>
   > Security misconfigurations are a major cause of security incidents.

     ![Secure Transfer](../Images/newimg3.png)

5. On the **Deny - Prevent resource creation**, select your subscription (which is currently set to audit mode). This allows you to ensure that from now on, a storage account without the security transfer feature turned on will be denied. Click on **Change to Deny**.

   **Note**: If you are unable to edit the query. Click on the eclipse select **change to Audit** and retry the step

    ![](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Security-Immersion/blob/main/Labs/Images/change%20to%20deny.png?raw=true)

6. Go back to the **recommendations view**, type **Auditing** in the search box,. Click on the recommendation **Auditing on SQL server should be enabled**.

   > **Note**: If you don't see the above recommendation, that means it is not loaded yet, and it could take up to 24 hours for all the recommendations to show up. It is possible that during lab time, this may not show up – which is the case sometimes. You can note down this step number then continue to the next exercise and verify this later.

    ![Auditing on SQL server should be enabled](../Images/asc-auditing-sql.gif?raw=true)

7. On the **Auditing on SQL server should be enabled** page, from the top menu bar, click on the **Enforce** button. This option allows you to take advantage of Azure policy’s DeployIfNotExist effect and automatically remediate non-compliant resources upon creation.

8. Once the **Configure SQL servers to have auditing enabled** pane opens with all of the policy configuration options, select the following configuration settings:

    * Under the **Basics** tab under the Scope header, select the ellipse icon **(...)** to select your subscription and  select the **asclab** for resource group and click on the **Select**.
    * Then click on **Next**.

        ![](../Images/lab3-8.png)
    
9. In the **Advanced** tab, leave it by default and click on **Next**.

      ![](../Images/lab3-9.png)

10. In the **Parameters** tab, leave the *Effect* and *Retention days* with default values.

     - **Uncheck** Only show parameters that need input or review
     - Leave options to default.
     - Select **Review + create** to assign the policy to your subscription.
     - Click **Create**

11. On the **Auditing on SQL server should be enabled** page, perform the following steps:

    - Select the **SQL Server resource (1)** found on the **unhealthy resources** tab of **Affected resources** named **<inject key="SQL Server" props="{\&quot;enableCopy\&quot;:true,\&quot;style\&quot;:{\&quot;fontWeight\&quot;:\&quot;bold\&quot;}}" />** 
    - click on **Fix (2)**
    - Select the **asclab-la-XXXXXX (3)** workspace from the dropdown
    - Click **Fix 1 resource (4)**
    
    By performing the above mentioned operations, you can now ensure that your existing resources and new ones will be enabled for auditing. Auditing on your SQL Server helps you track database activities across all databases on the server and save them in an audit log.
