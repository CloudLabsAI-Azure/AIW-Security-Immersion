# Secure Hybrid Cloud

## Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to secure hybrid cloud environments using Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly Azure Security Center). You will start by enabling Defender for Cloud on your Azure subscription and configuring data collection settings. Next, you will explore the Defender for Cloud dashboard, understand secure scores, recommendations, and inventory capabilities. You will then dive into security policies, regulatory compliance assessments, and methods to improve your secure posture. The lab covers enabling Azure Defender plans for advanced threat protection, exporting security data to a SIEM system, and implementing advanced cloud defense strategies. By the end, you will have hands-on experience in monitoring, assessing, and enhancing the security of your hybrid cloud workloads.

## Objective 

This lab provides practical experience in securing hybrid cloud environments with Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Participants will learn to enable and configure Defender for Cloud, assess security posture through dashboards and recommendations, manage security policies, ensure regulatory compliance, and implement advanced threat protection. The lab also covers integrating security insights with SIEM systems and applying advanced defense techniques to protect Azure, on-premises, and multi-cloud resources.
